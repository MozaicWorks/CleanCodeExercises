# Clean Code Exercices

This is a collection of exercises meant to help participants to the [Mozaic Works Clean Code Learning Program](https://craftacademy.mozaicworks.com/courses/clean-code/) to learn the various guidelines. 

The exercises are collected from various sources, sometimes slightly modified, sometimes translated to C# and C++. The translations and relevant modifications were contributed back through pull requests to the original repositories. Finally, we've selected only the C++ and C# versions.

A full list of initial sources follows. 

Comments:

* [UmbracoCMS](https://github.com/MozaicWorks/Umbraco-CMS/) for the C# files
* [Inkscape](https://gitlab.com/inkscape/inkscape) for the C++ files

Naming:

* An uglified version (all names renamed to be meaningless) of the [Tennis Refactoring](https://github.com/emilybache/Tennis-Refactoring-Kata/) kata, with the C++ version adapted to use doctest for simplicity
* [FinderRefactoring Kata](https://github.com/codecop/Finder-Refactoring-Kata). Contributed back the C++ translation.

Functions:

* An uglified version of the [Yatzy Refactoring Kata](https://github.com/emilybache/Yatzy-Refactoring-Kata) - everything moved into one large function and the code mixed up a bit
* [Refactor Conditionals](https://github.com/emilybache/Refactor-Conditionals/), with the C++ version adapted to use doctest

Classes:

* The [elections kata](https://github.com/SoftwareCraftsmanshipGrenoble/elections) by the Grenoble Software Craft community. Contributed back the C# and C++ versions.
